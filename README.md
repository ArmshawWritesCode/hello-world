Projects to prove Python Certified Entry-level Programming skills
Good evening, 
I am a new programmer who originally got into programming as a way to help my Dad think of new random passwords for his accounts after his identity was stolen, so I found a simple password generator snippet of code and loaded it into his computer. I was taking Aplus classes at the time. I have always loved writing in any form, and first became an Executive Assistant- hit the earning ceiling at 27; became a teacher - hit the earnings celiing this year at $44,200. So, that leads me back to IT and programming. My favorite hobby is playing Code Combat in Python, and looking for new projects to use to practice writing code. I am not yet good enough to make changes to code without a step by step instruction guide. I guess that's what it means to be entry-level. I am really excited to be working on a laptop, away from teenagers and using my wits, again -rather than regugitating the same lesson six times a day (180 times a year). 
Feel free to tell me what I am wrong, just explain how to fix it, too and we will get along splendidly.
Code Free, eveyone!
Sincerely,
Kaite
